   // Suppose I now want to print the area of the Shape.
   // Can I just do this?
   // cout << s->GetArea();


   // Since the Shape class does not have a GetArea function, the compiler
   // will not let me call GetArea, even if we *know* that s points to something
   // that DOES have a GetArea.

   
   // First attempt at printing the area: downcasting.
   // Ask the shape for its name, and then down-cast the pointer to an 
   // appropriate type.

      Rectangle *rPtr = (Rectangle*)s;
      cout << "; area " << rPtr->GetArea() << endl;
   }
   // What are the weaknesses of this approach?
   









   // Second attempt: add a GetArea function to the Shape class.



   // Now I can call GetArea on a Shape pointer!
   // cout << "; area " << s->GetArea() << endl;
   // What is the output? Why?





   // This takes us to virtu  al functions.
   // 1. Add keyword "virtual" to Shape's GetArea function. What does this mean?




   // 2. Now call GetArea on the Shape pointer. Whose GetArea is called?
   // cout << "; area " << s->GetArea() << endl;




   // 3. Is there a reasonable default implementation of GetArea? Should generic
   //    Shape objects really have an area? Does it make sense to construct full
   //    objects of type Shape? What can we do about this?
